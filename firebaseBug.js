The Firebase Authentication SDK might throw an error if the user's email or password is incorrect, or if the user account is disabled. The error message might not always be clear, and it could be difficult to determine the exact cause of the problem. Additionally, there could be issues with the Firebase Realtime Database or Firestore if data is not properly structured or if there are permission problems. These issues could lead to unexpected behavior or crashes in the application.  Another less common error can occur when using Firebase Cloud Functions. If the function is not properly configured or if there are issues with the function's code, it can cause errors or unexpected behavior.

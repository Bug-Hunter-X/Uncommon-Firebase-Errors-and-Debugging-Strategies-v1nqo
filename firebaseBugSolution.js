Improved error handling is crucial. Instead of relying on generic error messages, you should implement more specific error checks.  For authentication, verify email/password formats and handle disabled accounts explicitly. For databases, rigorously validate data before writing to prevent inconsistencies. Use transactions and proper security rules to maintain data integrity. In Cloud Functions, add detailed logging, structured error handling, and comprehensive testing.

# Uncommon Firebase Errors and Debugging Strategies

This repository contains examples of uncommon errors that can occur when using Firebase and strategies for debugging and resolving them.  The focus is on issues beyond simple typos or missing dependencies, such as nuanced authentication problems, database schema inconsistencies, and Cloud Function misconfigurations.  Each example includes the problematic code and a solution.

## Included Examples:

* **firebaseBug.js:** Demonstrates scenarios leading to less obvious authentication failures, improper data structuring in Realtime Database or Firestore, and poorly configured Cloud Functions.
* **firebaseBugSolution.js:** Provides solutions to the problems in firebaseBug.js, emphasizing improved error handling, input validation, proper schema design, and more robust function management.
